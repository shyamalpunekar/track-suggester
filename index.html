      <div id="Ruby-Rails">
          <li class="term">Ruby/Rails</li>
          <p class="defbox">Ruby-PHP is particularly well suited for organizing and transporting huge sets of information. For that reason PHP is the server-side language for 82.5% of all websites whose server-side language is known.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div id="PHP-Drupal">
          <li class="term">PHP/Drupal</li>
          <p class="defbox">In this course we'll focus on the fundamentals of programming web applications using PHP and the web framework Silex. Working with PHP and Silex, we'll use the MVC pattern of web development, where a program's core logic is written in its models (PHP classes). The user interface is coded in views (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). And controllers (Silex) will handle web requests, defining what model code to run and which views (Twig templates) to return back in the HTTP response.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="Java-Android">
          <li class="term">Java/Android</li>
          <p class="defbox">In this course we focus on the fundamentals of programming web applications using Java and the web framework Spark. Working with Java and Spark, we'll use the MVC pattern of web development, where a program's core logic is written in its models (Java classes). The user interface is coded in views (HTML/CSS/JavaScript). And controllers (Spark) will handle web requests, defining what model code to run and which views to return back in the HTTP response. Also,  we'll learn how to build Android apps, including how to create user interfaces, communicate with a backend server, and take advantage of device features.</p>

      <div id="CSS-Design">
          <li class="term">CSS/Design</li>

      <div id="C#-.NET">
          <li class="term">C#/.NET</li>
          <p class="defbox">Welcome to C#! You are about to begin your journey into the world of web development in the C# programming language.C# is the object-oriented component of the ASP.NET Framework. Microsoft Chief Architect and C# team leader Anders Hejlsberg described it as an iteration and improvement of the C++ language. Hejlsberg touted C# as "the first component-oriented language in the C/C++ family." As a result, it is " a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language" and to be "economical with regard to memory and processing power requirements</p>
